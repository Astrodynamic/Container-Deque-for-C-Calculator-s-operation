# Container `Deque` for C Calculator's operation

This is a library for working with arithmetic operations in different types of C calculators.

## Build

To build the library, simply run the following command:

```
cmake -S . -B ./build
cmake --build ./build
```

This will create a static library file `Deque.a` in the `./lib` folder.

## Usage

To use this library in your C calculator project, simply include the `deque.h` header file and link against the `Ddeque.a` library file:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "deque.h"

int main() {
    Deque* deque = init_deque();
    d_push_f(deque, NUMBER, 42.0);
    double value;
    d_get_number_f(deque, &value);
    printf("%f\n", value);
    return 0;
}
```

## Dependencies

This library has no external dependencies.
